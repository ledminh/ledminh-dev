This section was originally meant to list projects I’ve worked on. However, I don’t have many traditional work projects—mostly small, exploratory ones.

With recent advances in AI, many classic “personal projects” (todo apps, weather apps, blogs, etc.) can now be built in minutes with the help of tools. These are the kinds of projects that once took me hours or days and were valuable learning exercises at the time, but listing them today doesn’t say much about how I think, learn, or grow.
Most of my past projects followed a similar pattern: I learned a new technology, followed a course or tutorial, built something small, extended it a bit, and then moved on. Over the years, that has resulted in dozens—if not hundreds—of abandoned or forgotten experiments. Treating those as “projects” would be misleading.
Instead, I chose to focus on documenting my learning process:

- What I’m learning
- What I’m building while learning
- What I learn from building it

This approach is more useful to me in the long run, and it reflects my skills and understanding more honestly. Sometimes this process produces artifacts you might call “projects,” but they are byproducts, not the goal.

The focus here is the process, not the projects. Below is a list of entries documenting that learning process.
