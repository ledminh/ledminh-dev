I was a radiologist in Vietnam, but then I quit and moved to the U.S. to build my career in Computer Science. I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from San Jose State University in 2020.

My passion is in Frontend Web Development. I taught myself JavaScript, CSS, and HTML at home. I am very comfortable with ReactJS. Currently, I am trying to gain a deeper knowledge on vanilla JavaScript. My next plan would be getting to know UI/UX design. 

I also know C++, Java, MySQL, Linux, and a little bit of Verilog through various classes I took at school.

I do not have much experience working as a developer in the U.S. However, I am eager to learn what I have not known yet. I built some projects in JavaScript to showcase my skills. You can see the full list of my projects here: Github::My-Project. This list will be updated regularly as I am still learning and practicing to improving my skill.
