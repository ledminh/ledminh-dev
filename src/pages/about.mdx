<span className="intro">I was a radiologist in Vietnam, but then I quit and moved to the U.S. to build my career in Computer Science. I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from San Jose State University in 2020.</span>

##### THINGS I LOVE

My passion is in Frontend Web Development. I taught myself JavaScript, CSS, and HTML at home. I am very comfortable with ReactJS. Currently, I am trying to gain deeper knowledge on vanilla JavaScript. My next plan would be getting to know UI/UX design. I guess the passion comes from my past life when I was a radiologist in Vietnam. Back then, I managed an online forum for medical students. It was the first online forum in Vietnam for medical students (it was founded in 2001) that attracted more than 8000 members, including doctors and medical students. Even though I did not know anything about programming and could not read much in English, I maintained the forum well enough that it lasted for 9 years before totally shut down.

##### THINGS I ALSO KNOW

C++ is the first programming language I learned. I used it in my data structure class. One of my proudest C++ projects is a simple graphic app I built in the “Intro to Computer Graphic” class at school. I coded it with the help of the framework named openframework.

Java is the second language that I learned. I used it extensively in most of my classes at school, including Algorithm, Programming Paradigms, Formal Languages and Computability, and Object-Oriented Design.

I learned MySQL, Linux, and a little bit of Verilog in other classes.

##### THINGS I DO

I admit that I do not have much experience working as a developer in the U.S. However, I am eager to learn what I have not known yet. I built some projects in JavaScript to showcase my skills. You can see the full list of my projects here: <a href="https://github.com/ledminh/my-projects" target="__blank">Github::My-Projects</a>. This list will be updated regularly as I am still learning and practicing to improving my skill.

##### OTHER THINGS I DO

I love writing. During the last three years, I have written a lot about science and medicine, especially vaccines, in Vietnamese on Facebook. I have built multiple blogs using WordPress to store my writing, but then I deleted them all for various reasons.

##### MY NEXT PLAN

I have two ambitious goals. The first is to code a blog from scratch, something like WordPress but of my own so that I can customize it to fit in with my need (and also my imagination) to write about medicine and science in Vietnamese. The second is to be knowledgeable enough such that I can write extensively about programming, especially Frontend Website Development, in English. It is a long way to go but I believe I will get there, eventually.
