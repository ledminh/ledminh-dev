I was a radiologist in Vietnam, but then I quit and moved to the U.S. to build my career in Computer Science. I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from San Jose State University in 2020.

My passion is in Frontend Web Development. I taught myself <Emphasize level={1}>JavaScript</Emphasize>, <Emphasize level={1}>CSS</Emphasize>, and <Emphasize level={1}>HTML</Emphasize> at home. I am very comfortable with <Emphasize level={2}>ReactJS</Emphasize>. Currently, I am trying to gain deeper knowledge on <Emphasize level={1}>vanilla JavaScript</Emphasize>. My next plan would be getting to know <Emphasize level={4}>UI/UX design</Emphasize>. 

I also know <Emphasize level={3}>C++</Emphasize>, <Emphasize level={3}>Java</Emphasize>, <Emphasize level={3}>MySQL</Emphasize>, <Emphasize level={3}>Linux</Emphasize>, and a little bit of <Emphasize level={4}>Verilog</Emphasize> through various classes I took at school.

I do not have much experience working as a developer in the U.S. However, I am eager to learn what I have not known yet. I built some projects in JavaScript to showcase my skills. You can see the full list of my projects here: <a href="https://github.com/ledminh/my-projects" target="__blank">Github::My-Projects</a>. This list will be updated regularly as I am still learning and practicing to improving my skill.
